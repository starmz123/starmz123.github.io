        <title>Realizing I just justified the past hour at a social as &#39;for impact,&#39; but didn&#39;t realize it because I didn&#39;t literally think about impact (I was thinking, &amp;quot;you can help people!&amp;quot;) Agh. But now I&#39;m aware, next time I&#39;ll give greater weight to following what seems exciting and frivolous.</title>

        <title>My cup overfloweth: I am beyond grateful to the EA community, which has *continuously* exceeded my expectations.</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;My cup overfloweth â˜• Beyond grateful to the EA community, which has &lt;em&gt;continuously&lt;/em&gt; exceeded my expectations. Acquaintances and friends alike have supported me emotionally, logistically, and financially, enabling me to keep pursuing what I think are the likeliest paths for me to have the most positive impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this partly due to EA&amp;rsquo;s unusually high trust in its community? If so, this is yet another special thing I want to preserve about EA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part, I&amp;rsquo;m sure, comes from how EA attracts some of the world&amp;rsquo;s most kind, intelligent, &amp;amp; driven people. ðŸ¥°&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Feeling surprisingly energized by AI discussion, but mainly when (a) I&#39;m successfully learning (so this is not a signal about the domain), (b) evaluating AI safety stories (maybe a sign I should trial strategy fit?), (c)  talking to my friends (I am extremely suspicious of this convergence and would bet on this leading me to overestimate the impact of these discussions)</title>

        <title>pivoted from testing technical research fit to reading about s-risks and I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by the fact that, for the first time in a bit, I&#39;m actually keen to spend my day ~ working ~ (e.g., I&#39;m bothered by distractions and want to turn my notifications off)</title>

&lt;p&gt;(definitely still testing fit - have scheduled something for next sunday, and might still do some AIS stuff today!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Doing chores in the morning is one of the most relaxing experiences for me, but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure why!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I get to feel productive while playing music / watching something (feels better than just purely relaxing, where I have the background thought that I can&amp;rsquo;t justify relaxing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical work is repetitive, largely thoughtless, and hence relaxing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling very productive in the morning is nice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &gt;rest day&lt;/a&gt; look like writing personal reflections, gaining emotional insight, and/or brainstorming world-changing ideas.Mine is looking like a lot of HSMTMTS sing-alongs and in an effort to not judge myself for it, I&amp;rsquo;m going to just be really into this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently my resting state is singing really badly and not producing impact, and this is totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;
