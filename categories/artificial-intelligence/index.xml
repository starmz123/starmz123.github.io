        <title>Feeling surprisingly energized by AI discussion, but mainly when (a) I&#39;m successfully learning (so this is not a signal about the domain), (b) evaluating AI safety stories (maybe a sign I should trial strategy fit?), (c)  talking to my friends (I am extremely suspicious of this convergence and would bet on this leading me to overestimate the impact of these discussions)</title>

        <title>pivoted from testing technical research fit to reading about s-risks and I&#39;m pleasantly surprised by the fact that, for the first time in a bit, I&#39;m actually keen to spend my day ~ working ~ (e.g., I&#39;m bothered by distractions and want to turn my notifications off)</title>

&lt;p&gt;(definitely still testing fit - have scheduled something for next sunday, and might still do some AIS stuff today!)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Want to test your fit for AI technical safety research with me?</title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m open to a variety of options, whether a couple hours over several days or a weekend &amp;lsquo;retreat!&amp;rsquo; (I&amp;rsquo;m kind of psyched about the retreat option, which is probably just crashing a group house)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I keep saying that &amp;lsquo;I should (and will) test my fit for AI technical research,&amp;rsquo; but actually doing this seems increasingly aversive. So, here&amp;rsquo;s an open call to my non-technical (and technical, if you enjoy watching your friend(s) struggle) friends to spend a day testing our fits for AISTR!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was thinking we could try finding solutions for ELK or follow Holden Karnofsky&amp;rsquo;s advice in this post: &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/.../important&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/.../important&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(context: me having blocked out the entire day to do this, and feeling worried I&amp;rsquo;m going to give up halfway through)&lt;/p&gt;
