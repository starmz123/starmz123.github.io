        <description>&lt;p&gt;Starting to think the way through imposter syndrome blocking further thought/writing is, &amp;ldquo;just do it anyway.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t know enough? Maybe that&amp;rsquo;s true, but just do it anyway. There&amp;rsquo;s probably no harm, and lots of benefit, in writing up thoughts and getting feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s also useful that I&amp;rsquo;m realizing that this behaviour, and related thoughts such as &amp;ldquo;this is somebody else&amp;rsquo;s job; how can I produce anything valuable when they work on it full-time?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough to say anything worthy&amp;rdquo; is a form of imposter syndrome!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Three updates on my burnout</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/three-updates-on-my-burnout/</link>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/three-updates-on-my-burnout/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: One fourth, general update is that burnout is ill-defined and very individual, so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want you to apply any of my takeaways to your own situation unless you understand my context and resonate strongly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I talked about burnout with my new therapist and, oh boy, it&amp;rsquo;s really reinforcing my perception that so much of the value from therapy comes from noticing and questioning things-you-might-be-getting-wrong. Here are three ways I updated today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;should-is-shorthand-for-strategic&#34;&gt;Should is shorthand for strategic&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; When I say I &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; be doing, all I&amp;rsquo;m doing is positing a hypothesis. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t justify beating myself up for not doing something I think I &amp;lsquo;should,&amp;rsquo; because it&amp;rsquo;s not an obligation or value judgment. I&amp;rsquo;m simply choosing which experiments I want to run right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been saying that I &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; take a full break: go on a vacation, stop seeing EAs, go on a road trip. But what does this even mean?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotionally, it means I feel guilty because I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;m doing what is best. But in this context, applying a judgment like &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; is only useful if it points me towards the most effective way to recover from burnout. So when I say I &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; take a full break, I am claiming that taking a full break would be strategically optimal for&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energizing me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imbuing my life with a sense of regular &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joie_de_vivre&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;joie de vivre&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raising my baseline mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are testable! So when I say &amp;lsquo;should,&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;m really making a claim (positing a hypothesis) that can be confirmed or falsified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also say something like, I &amp;lsquo;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; be upskilling or talking about EA. Yet, sometimes, those things also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Energize me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Raise my mood&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imbue my life with a sense of excitement and wonder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So guess what—things that I &amp;lsquo;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo; do provide evidence for what may be strategically better/worse for me. Why &lt;em&gt;shouldn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/em&gt; I do these things, then? Because people who have no access to my internal experience recommended something different for burnout recovery?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when I say I &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; be trying lots of different activities to find an energizing hobby, I&amp;rsquo;m positing that an energizing hobby will be crucial for my burnout recovery. When my therapist questioned this, I broke a little (in a good way). What do you mean, maybe I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt; to find a consistently atelic hobby to recover?&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Maybe—alternative hypothesis—becoming energized is more about my mindset than whatever I&amp;rsquo;m doing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, nowhere does saying &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; break down into&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am obligated to do this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is moral to do this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am failing if I am not doing this&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; just represents the claim I hold the most credence in at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;exploration--excitement-is-an-orientation&#34;&gt;Exploration &amp;amp; excitement is an orientation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/strong&gt; As a meditation guru might say—it&amp;rsquo;s all about your mind. Maybe I can &lt;em&gt;make&lt;/em&gt; activities exciting, rather than finding exciting activities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Searching&lt;/em&gt; has been a theme throughout the past month (even after my job search), as I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeking adventure and excitement and freedom! Let&amp;rsquo;s call what I&amp;rsquo;ve been seeking, &amp;ldquo;zest for life&amp;rdquo; (what I consider the English version of &lt;em&gt;joie de vivre&lt;/em&gt;). Naturally, this brings to mind escapist fantasies of going on a road trip, skydiving, or just taking a complete break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One hypothesis is that exciting activities are what generate a zest for life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another hypothesis is that my mindset is what generates a zest for life, such that I can find a sense of exploration and excitement in many ordinary activities, like chilling with my friends or &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://example.com/p/positive-focusing/&#34; &gt;listening to music&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure which is more accurate, but I hadn&amp;rsquo;t even considered the latter as a possibility. My therapist questioning whether I necessarily had to find a hobby to recover from burnout, however, has opened up a new approach that I&amp;rsquo;m excited about. What if the core issue is my mindset, such that (a) I might not find a reliably energizing activity until I address my attitude &amp;amp; (b) I might not need a reliably energizing &lt;em&gt;activity,&lt;/em&gt; because I can turn anything into this with the right mindset?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on my previous therapeutic experiences, this direction seems promising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;embracing-irresponsibility-is-the-key-to-my-burnout&#34;&gt;[Embracing] Irresponsibility is the key to my burnout&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/b&gt; I want to feel gleeful about not doing what I &amp;lsquo;should&amp;rsquo; be doing and/or what the average person is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past month, I&amp;rsquo;ve felt sheepish about my efforts to address my burnout. Specifically, I would feel insecure and ashamed when I was asked, &amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;ldquo;Trying to recover from burnout.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Them:&lt;/b&gt; &#34;What are you doing to recover?&#34;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Me, internally: Wow, they can&#39;t find out that I have no idea, because then they might think I&#39;m dumb/not serious/incompetent/un-strategic etc. And that would reflect poorly on me, and my commitment to this community, and my impact.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;Me:&lt;/b&gt; Oh, I&#39;m doing a pretty bad job. I&#39;m generally just chilling and ... trying a bunch of activities to see if I can find a hobby I reliably enjoy... 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funny thing is, I would still express loads of uncertainty and confusion—I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really trying to hide it, but I would feel down on myself for feeling this way. My therapist suggested that I assume that others are by default critical, which does seem accurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if people are, or even if I come across someone who is more critical than average, I should embrace what I&amp;rsquo;m doing nevertheless. I call this embracing &lt;em&gt;irresponsibility:&lt;/em&gt; who cares if other people think I&amp;rsquo;m doing fuck-all? Let them be confused! Let them be judgemental! It doesn&amp;rsquo;t change that I&amp;rsquo;m leading my life the best way I think I can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve only really tapped into this sense of irreverence once before—when I was rejected from all but one of the T20s to which I applied. Interestingly, that also came with a sense of shame and failure—I was just able to get over that and feel defiance, instead. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to tap into this again, but I suspect I can brute-force it with enough practice!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still think &amp;lsquo;find a reliable hobby&amp;rsquo; is a good hypothesis, but I feel less justified in getting down on myself for not making enough progress on this. Maybe not making progress is just a sign that my hypothesis was wrong!&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        <title>My current hypothesis for an emotional processing workflow that works for me</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/july-emotional-workflow/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/july-emotional-workflow/</guid>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;carve-out-time-to-process&#34;&gt;Carve out time to process.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someday, I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to do this faster. But right now, it takes me like 10-15 minutes to deeply dive into what I&amp;rsquo;m feeling, and I think this is really productive lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;name-acknowledge-and-accept-the-feeling&#34;&gt;Name, acknowledge, and accept the feeling.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g., &amp;ldquo;Wow, this news makes me feel really bad. But why? Oh &amp;hellip; Probably because I feel envy. But what is it about envy that feels bad? Oh - it&amp;rsquo;s because envy leads to self-deprecation and comparison, where you think you aren&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;enough.&amp;rdquo; And this makes you sad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something about naming the feeling helps me get to the associated thoughts. For some reason, I often feel like I don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; immediate negative thoughts because it&amp;rsquo;s so hard for me to &amp;lsquo;hear&amp;rsquo; them. But it&amp;rsquo;s easier for me to identify, I think, when I hit upon the emotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focusing on being curious so I can identify the emotion is also a great way to avoid judging myself! Judging myself is a surefire way to keep feeling awful (e.g., &amp;ldquo;wow, you can&amp;rsquo;t even be happy for them or feel grateful for what you have?&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;come-up-with-alternate-frames-or-compassionate-thoughts&#34;&gt;Come up with alternate frames or compassionate thoughts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very much in the style of, &amp;lsquo;what would you say to a friend?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, this step has felt way too effortful for me, to the point where I thought CBT was just less effective for me than DBT or radical acceptance. But I think I actually &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; do CBT effectively - I just need to first get to a less emotionally-activated place, and then sometimes I hit upon a framing that REALLY works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;e.g., &amp;ldquo;You are not as smart or competent&amp;rdquo; ➡️ &amp;ldquo;oh man, you are smart and competent in so many ways. And so is X! … Just because you didn’t get this one job doesn’t mean you’re not as smart or as competent. It just means you have different skills. And having different skills is great, because we need all kinds of people to help solve the world’s problems.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wow, did that framing ever work! I have reaffirmed my value, and I am now able to fully embrace the pride I feel for X and nudge my envy into a quiet appreciation for their gifts + striving to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;figure-out-some-way-to-remember-the-techniques-that-work-for-me&#34;&gt;Figure out some way to remember the techniques that work for me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;still working on this :( I log things on Notion/Facebook/my website but I really feel wish I had a better memory lol. Maybe I should start making flashcards.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On treating oneself with curiosity and compassion</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/treating-oneself-with-curiosity-and-compassion/</link>
        <pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>https://example.com/p/treating-oneself-with-curiosity-and-compassion/</guid>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;On Facebook, I wondered whether anyone &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; defaulted to treating themselves with curiosity / compassion after a mistake? E.g., thinking &amp;ldquo;Great, I&amp;rsquo;m learning more about myself and how to improve!&amp;rdquo; vs &amp;ldquo;Wow, I suck at this.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My friend Nikola Jurkovic had some wonderful insights into how to lean into the former framing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;on-framing-mistakes-as-learning&#34;&gt;On framing mistakes as learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;rsquo;t suffer much from beating myself up over mistakes and it&amp;rsquo;s mostly because I don&amp;rsquo;t really think &amp;ldquo;mistake&amp;rdquo; is that coherent of a concept. there are input-output pairs to how the world behaves, and sometimes I badly predict how certain imputs correspond to certain outputs, and then I can be like &amp;ldquo;oh, I guess that doesn&amp;rsquo;t work that way”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for instance a few weeks ago I was super sleepy and having the last conversation of the day with some people and I made a comment that was slightly snarky/insulting to one of the people I was talking to, and I was like &amp;ldquo;fuck I just made a mistake and I feel bad and I&amp;rsquo;m bad&amp;rdquo; for a moment until I caught the feeling and started thinking about it the normal way of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;is this a sign I have to set up better internal systems or was this a bet I&amp;rsquo;d take again?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;achieving-this-mindset&#34;&gt;Achieving this mindset&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;internalizing-determinismno-free-will-and-human-fallibility&#34;&gt;internalizing determinism/no free will and human fallibility.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m almost never angry at other people because I see everything, including other people, mostly as physical systems going through timesteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cup dropped from shoulder height will fall and shatter when it hits the ground. Water in a pot will boil when a fire is lit under it. Everything is reducible to simple physical processes, and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a point on the cup-human spectrum where I&amp;rsquo;m like &amp;ldquo;ah, that&amp;rsquo;s complex enough, now I can get angry at it!&amp;rdquo;. It makes no sense to be angry at a cup for shattering when it hits the ground - it did what cups do when they hit the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, it makes no sense to be angry at a human doing something wrong - it did what humans sometimes do. Keep in mind that here I&amp;rsquo;m not advocating never feeling the emotion of anger. I&amp;rsquo;m saying that on some platonic level, there&amp;rsquo;s nothing bad or wrong about following the laws of physics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably good to feel anger some of the time, but noone &amp;ldquo;deserves&amp;rdquo; to be angry at. There are probably ways to feel anger while also not directing it towards specific people. Most of the anger I feel is vaguely towards the universe dealing us a bad deck. But it&amp;rsquo;s not anger at others, it&amp;rsquo;s anger &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; others, similar to the distinction of laughing at someone vs laughing &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone does something &amp;ldquo;wrong&amp;rdquo; to hurt me, &lt;strong&gt;the thought that&amp;rsquo;s going through my mind is mostly &amp;ldquo;it sucks that the universe is like this, that people can get hurt for no good reason, and I will punch the universe until no-one is ever hurt again&amp;rdquo;. Not because the universe &amp;ldquo;deserves&amp;rdquo; to be punched, but because I want to punch things and the universe just so happens not to feel pain when punched (by &amp;ldquo;punch the universe&amp;rdquo; i mostly mean &amp;ldquo;change the world with determination&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;cultivating-loving-kindness-towards-myself-and-towards-others&#34;&gt;cultivating loving kindness towards myself and towards others&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how determinist buddhism is generally, but in it there&amp;rsquo;s this very nice idea that basically, everyone is looking for happiness. Everyone is trying to make their corner of the universe a little bit better, but some people are confused or hurt, and in their confusion and pain, hurt others and themselves in trying to do this. I think that this is abstractly very close to the truth, but there are some exceptions, such as sadists, but sadists are victims of their own preferences being unaligned with others, which they too didn&amp;rsquo;t choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this insight is also true very often on a smaller level. I&amp;rsquo;ve found that most of the time people snap at me in anger, they are undergoing high amount of physical pain in that moment. They might be very tired, they might have a piercing headache or toothache, they might be suffering from a disease. People who are suffering are much more likely to be angry than those who are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this perspective, when someone snaps angrily at me, I don&amp;rsquo;t really feel hurt that much, I&amp;rsquo;m mostly thinking &amp;ldquo;this person is very likely in a lot of pain right now, and I wonder what caused that, and what I can do to help them&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;pointing-mental-habits-inwards-how-would-you-treat-others&#34;&gt;pointing mental habits inwards: how would you treat others?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In therapy there is a very useful technique used in many different approaches, and that is judging oneself similarly to how one judges others (of course, having the foundation of not judging others harshly).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people can beat themselves up for mistakes they made as children, but when described a different child who made the same mistakes, feel nothing but compassion and sorrow for the child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial step here is realizing that there is nothing about you being you that makes your mistakes bigger than other people&amp;rsquo;s mistakes. You&amp;rsquo;re just like other people: half-monkey-half-god, and the monkey half is very often confused and hurt, and makes mistakes in its confusion and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;you-are-just-a-physical-system-what-is-the-best-way-to-make-yourself-run-smoothly&#34;&gt;you are just a physical system. what is the best way to make yourself run smoothly?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And so, when you bring it all together, you are a physical system that follows the laws of physics, half-monkey-half-god, that has certain parts which aren&amp;rsquo;t used to the world, and there&amp;rsquo;s no difference between you and other people that&amp;rsquo;d make your mistakes bigger than others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this framing, you could imagine someone else living your life, making the same mistakes, and you&amp;rsquo;re tasked with taking care of them and making sure they thrive. How would you talk to them? What advice would you give them? Would you yell at them? Show them love and compassion? The answer to these questions should dictate how you actually treat yourself internally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;see-everything-as-a-bet&#34;&gt;see everything as a bet&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connected to determinism is the mindset of seeing everything as a bet. You bet on how specific actions will lead to specific outcomes, and sometimes, they don&amp;rsquo;t. But, as with any other bets, sometimes people lose bets that are worth taking, and sometimes people win bets that aren&amp;rsquo;t worth taking. Instead of looking at the outcome of the bet itself, I think it&amp;rsquo;s better to focus most of our attention of the information we had while taking on the bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, sometimes telling the truth bites me in the ass, but I don&amp;rsquo;t beat myself up when this happens. This is not because I place some innate value on telling the truth, but because I realized long ago that telling the truth is on average more useful than not doing it. There are times that this will bite me in the ass, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bet I&amp;rsquo;d  take again, as on average, it has been useful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think another thing useful in internalizing determinism/ the laws of physics/ everything being a bet, is that when you take a high EV bet that results in you losing, then you basically took the punch for all the parallel universe yous that won. The actual truth value of this statement is debatable because map != territory and many worlds may not be true, but on a higher level this is a useful abstraction&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Noticing that my incredible gratitude/surprise at people in my life helping me overcome problems might signal that, on the flip side, I&#39;m not well-calibrated on how tractable problems are and/or am easily dissuaded by problems. </title>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;Noticing that my incredible gratitude/surprise at people in my life helping me overcome problems might signal that, on the flip side, I&amp;rsquo;m not well-calibrated on how tractable problems are and/or am easily dissuaded by problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.g., I had considered one solution that involved someone helping me, but dismissed it as too implausible. When I talked about my problem with the person, they raised the exact same solution I&amp;rsquo;d come up with - the one I thought would&amp;rsquo;ve been too ludicrous to ask for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Examples of behaviours I want to do more of instead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ignore the first time the thought, &amp;ldquo;this is too hard, let&amp;rsquo;s give up&amp;rdquo; comes up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ask for things directly (bottleneck: social cost. Solution: find socially charismatic ways of posing requests? Maybe something like, &amp;ldquo;would it be absurd to ask for &amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When faced with a problem I have no idea how to solve, set a 5 minute timer and brainstorm wildly. Then ask a friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generically adopting a policy of, &amp;ldquo;anything is solvable if you try hard enough!&amp;rdquo; (It&amp;rsquo;s just about the trade offs you&amp;rsquo;re willing to make)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Feedback update (yes, I take these seriously!)</title>
        <link>https://example.com/p/feedback-akash/</link>

        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Thinking about some feedback I got on the doc and I want to taboo &amp;ldquo;impact&amp;rdquo; as a justification. Unless I&amp;rsquo;m joking, if I say I want to do something for &amp;ldquo;impact&amp;rdquo; and don&amp;rsquo;t provide a theory of change for the action, if you point this out to me then I will give you $5. This will hold until January 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Someone told me that they were confused why I was moving to Oakland &amp;amp; that living there (instead of Berkeley) was going to bottleneck my impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clarify both why I&amp;rsquo;m moving to Oakland and how I&amp;rsquo;m thinking around the impact rationale behind my move to the Bay Area, I wrote up &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01pkjl0mwyHkd_K9udnRj3MGJhSySt_UXjWhpgYeao/edit?usp=drivesdk&amp;amp;fbclid=IwAR3tsZJ4YUl-kdMPplbOwfCxm1m0FT1pR-GVseSQ3ucZVDSFfr90XYfr2X0&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;this doc&lt;/a&gt; (per their suggestion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, y&amp;rsquo;all, I&amp;rsquo;m disappointed that this is the most critical thing I&amp;rsquo;ve received. If something is preventing you from leaving me critical feedback, let me know anonymously! Let&amp;rsquo;s fix this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(FWIW, I think a stronger criticism emerges from this feedback that I got, which is something like - &amp;ldquo;right now, you&amp;rsquo;re not a good enough community builder to be impactful. This could be resolved if you lived in Berkeley.&amp;rdquo; I would be interested in further exploring this, if I got feedback on why I&amp;rsquo;m not a good enough community builder)&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;processing feedback update: successfully processed some of the most detailed feedback I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten yet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;things that actively helped:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;imagining being a new homunculus (thanks, Olivia Jimenez!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;externalizing into action items (thanks, Ari Kagan!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;contextual things that seem difficult to replicate, but probably helped:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I decided on a job, which feels like gain that counterbalances this professional &amp;rsquo;loss&#39;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I went through several days that felt emotionally worse than this and/or I got some emotional/temporal distance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
